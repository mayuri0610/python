# Abstraction is used to hide the internal functionality of the function from the users. 
# The users only interact with the basic implementation of the function, but inner working is hidden. 
# User is familiar with that "what function does" but they don't know "how it does."

# Abtraction is achive through abtract class and abtract method 
# Abtract class : Abtract class is a class that contains one or more abstract methods is called as abtract class.
# An abstract class is a class that is designed to be specifically used as a base class.
# Abtract method : An abstract method is a method that has a declaration but does not have an implementation.



# abstractmethod: abstractmethod is a decorator provided by the abc module that marks a method as abstract. 
# Abstract methods are declared in abstract classes without providing an implementation. 
# Subclasses that inherit from an abstract class must provide concrete implementations for these abstract methods.
