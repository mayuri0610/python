	ex:
		which one will you prefer to do?
		1. Using Laptop in home
		2. Explore the Tourist place
		3. Playing the out door game
		4. Solve Mathematical Problems
		
		ans1= 1

	According to the answer the ouput will be in top 2 domain priority wise
		
		1. Science
		2. Arts 

	note: Question Will be of your Choice

**7. Lets Play KBC
	
	You have to ask 15 Qustion based on Codeing consisting of 5 option out of 5 , 1 option is common i.e. Quit
	
	In this game there are certain stages if the candidate cross that particular stage then the minimum amount will be fixed for him/her there are two stages 1st stage is at qus no 5 and 2nd stage is qus  no 10
	if candidate cross question no 5 the minimum amout will be fixed i.e. 10,000

	if candidate does'nt want to continue the game then need to press on quite the output should be maximum winning amount
	
	15		?1 Crore
	14		?50,00,000	
	13		?25,00,000
